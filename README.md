# GRANTH-AI

GRANTH-AI is an educational information platform designed to help students understand their curriculum through
clear, accessible and evidence-grounded answers. It aims to make verified educational knowledge easier to access
for students across languages, subjects and educational boards.

- **IDEA CONTRIBUTOR: BHAVESHBHAI SOLANKI**
- **FOUNDER & PROJECT DEVELOPER: DIVYESH BAMBHANIYA**

A student picks Board → Medium → Standard → Subject → Textbook → Chapter and asks a question in Gujarati, English
or a mix. The answer is taken only from the text of the selected, approved source and is shown as
**પ્રશ્ન / સરળ જવાબ / મુખ્ય મુદ્દા / પુસ્તકનો આધાર / વિશ્વસનીયતા સ્થિતિ**, with a link to the cited page. If the
source does not support an answer, GRANTH-AI says so:

> આ પસંદ કરેલા પાઠ્યપુસ્તકમાં આ પ્રશ્નનો પૂરતો આધાર મળ્યો નથી.

## What is and is not supported today (2026-11-13)

**No official board textbook is included.** No GSEB, NCERT or other board, standard or subject is supported yet,
because no publisher permission exists (GSSTB: UNKNOWN, NCERT: DENIED, DIKSHA: UNKNOWN — see the
[permission register](docs/COPYRIGHT_AND_PERMISSION_REGISTER.md)).

What the app actually contains:

| Content | Role | Permission |
|---|---|---|
| 3 small self-written demo books, "GRANTH-AI Sample Board (demo – NOT GSEB)", Std 10 Science (2 editions) and Social Science, Gujarati | textbook | APPROVED (own work, CC BY 4.0) |
| 1 self-written 4-page supplementary note set (Newton's third law, Constitution dates, quadratic equation, mitosis/meiosis) | supplementary, opt-in only | APPROVED (own work, CC BY 4.0); not reviewed by a teacher |
| A student's own pasted notes | personal, private to that student | user-provided |

The engine, registry and UI are board-, standard- and language-agnostic: a new approved source is added by writing a
`book.json` and ingesting it; nothing in the core changes.

| Area | State |
|---|---|
| Answer engine `extractive-1.1`: Gujarati, English and mixed questions; definitions, short/detailed/points, marks-based, differences, formulas, worked examples step by step; refusal when unsupported or ambiguous | Working, tested |
| Structured answer with reliability status (Verified against source / Partially supported / Insufficient source evidence), no percentages | Working, tested |
| Opt-in supplementary source, shown in a separate labelled block | Working, tested |
| Private personal notes (rights confirmation, per-student, never cached or published, deletable) | Working, tested |
| Shared verified-answer cache, saved answers, history | Working, tested |
| Voice and camera question input | Working in an emulated browser only (mock recogniser; printed text). **Not tested on a real phone** |
| Exam mode, revision, practice questions, dictionary, offline library | Working, tested |
| PDF ingestion with Gujarati OCR + admin review | Working on a printed sample PDF (mean character error 6.5%) |

Honest limits: answers are the source's own sentences, selected and arranged — the app does not paraphrase unless an
optional AI provider is configured (none is, and none is required). Questions that use different words from the
book are often refused (see [answer engine report](docs/ANSWER_ENGINE_REPORT.md)).

## Run it

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install pymupdf pytest
npm install                                  # OCR engine + test tools
.venv/bin/python scripts/setup_vendor.py     # copies the OCR engine into web/vendor (not committed)
.venv/bin/python -m granth seed-samples      # loads the demo books and the supplementary notes
.venv/bin/python -m granth serve             # http://localhost:8000
```

The server needs only the Python standard library; PyMuPDF and Node are needed for PDF ingestion and OCR.
An existing database from the first version is upgraded automatically (migration 002).
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` to change settings; set `GRANTH_ADMIN_TOKEN` to use the review page (`/#/admin`).

## Test it

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests -q                    # 101 engine / API / ingestion tests
npm test                                               # 18 browser-module tests
npm run test:e2e                                       # 31 browser steps (headless Chromium, phone-size viewport)
.venv/bin/python benchmarks/run_benchmarks.py --ocr    # 48-question in-house set + acceptance + OCR
.venv/bin/python benchmarks/run_independent.py         # 92-check independent set (83 pass, 9 fail — listed in the report)
```
